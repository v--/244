# # Problem description
#
# My friend VictORia and I are planning a road trip.
#
# We want to drive from Madrid to Copenhagen and we've seen there are a lot of ways to do it.
#
# Most probably, even if we wanted to go through Budapest, we cannot go that path. We have a limited budget for fuel of 73â‚¬, and we want to get the shortest possible way.
#
# Can you help me solve this problem?

# %% [markdown]
# # Problem data

# %% [markdown]
# Here are the first 20 lines of the provided data file:
#     
#     # The first line gives you:
#     # <number of potential cities to visit> <number of connections between them> <max budget in euros for fuel>
#     # The rest of the lines gives you the connections between cities, with the distance between them and the cost to travel from the first to the second one:
#     # <first city> <second city> <distance> <euros wasted in fuel>
#     
#     # In this instance, you have 100 cities with 955 connections between them, and 73 euros to spend on fuel
#     # Connection between cities 1 and 37 has a distance of 60 and a cost of 5 euros of fuel,
#     # connection between cities 1 and 59 has a distance of 9 and a cost of 59 euros of fuel,
#     # and so on and so forth
#     
#     # Madrid is the city 1
#     # Copenhagen is the city 100
#     
#      100 955 73 
#      1 37 60 5 
#      1 59 9 59 
#      1 72 63 1 
#      2 15 61 1 
#      2 20 16 39 
#      2 26 54 6 
#

# %% [markdown]
# # Solution
#
# We enumerate the simple paths from shortest to longest and check which of them fit the budget.
