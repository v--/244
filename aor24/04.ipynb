    "# Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi, I'm SalvadOR, responsible for creating a school timetable to organize classes, teachers, and rooms for an upcoming semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some strict requirements to meet. This is a very hard problem we face every year, and I need your help to design an optimal timetable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are 4 classes, each requiring specific teaching sessions.\n",
    "* There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has assigned subjects to teach.\n",
    "* There are 4 rooms, and only one class can occupy a room during any given period.\n",
    "* The timetable spans 30 periods, and we must ensure that all requirements are met without any conflicts or overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "I desperately need a timetable that satisfies all requirements (each class meets with the right teacher in the right room the required number of times), avoiding any type of clashes such as double-booking a teacher, room, or class during the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say a timetable is optimized when it minimizes idle periods and maximizes resource utilization (teachers and rooms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you help me solve this problem?"

    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We build a graph whose vertices are quadruples (room, class, teacher, lesson id), with an edge if at least one of the first three coincide (we produce unique lesson ids). Then the problem reduces to finding a graph coloring, the colors representing different periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that NetworkX's greedy coloring does not produce a time table that fits in 30 periods. Either a specialized algorithm or another approach is needed."
