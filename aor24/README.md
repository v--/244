# Advent of Operation Research 2024

I signed up for [AOR24](https://advent.bmenendez.com/), but soon realized it was a competition with vague questions rather than a simple daily puzzle. So I gave up after receiving the sixth challenge:

    Hi, IsiDOra qui ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

    I'm a railway operations planner in La FerrORvia Italiana.

    Our railway system in Italy is one of the busiest in Europe, and efficient planning is crucial to maitaining smooth operations.

    We face a logistical challenge: optimizing the assignment of maintenance resources to ensure that all critical segments of our railway network are covered.

    We want to minimize the costs of such operations.

    Can you help me solve this problem?

The data given was a dictionary with 63k entries mapping lists of segments to maintenance costs.

If I received such a task during my software development job, I would gladly interrogate the author to provide me with necessary details.
