# Advent of Operation Research 2024

This repository contains solutions to [AOR24](https://advent.bmenendez.com/).

The code is illustrative and as such is kept as simple as possible. I have shared the Jupyter notebooks directly rather than, say, using [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) because GitHub doesn't know how to render the latter. There is no functionality in the code that should rely on a very specific version of Python or any library --- any version supported as of late 2024 should do. My development environment uses specific versions and linting rules, however I saw to benefit in extracting such configurations for run-once code.

The data files are parsed manually because they are in such a way that using CSV parsers or pandas actually takes more effort.
